#dalrimple.com blog site

This is the repo for the dalrimple.com blog. Hosted as static files, it is built using [Jekyll][jekyll].

I've also mashed together the [Fluid Baseline Grid][FBG] and [Skeleton][skeleton] CSS libraries for the basis of the site's styling.

[skeleton]: http://www.getskeleton.com/ "Skeleton responsive CSS library"
