#dalrimple?

My name is actually Daniel Zabinskas, 'dalrimple' is a nickname that my friend Miguel gave me and it just kind of stuck. Also it is hardly ever taken whenever I need to come up with a username when I'm signing up for stuff.

I'm a technophile, audiophile, I live in Melbourne Australia, and I love a good steak and a drink with mates. I work at Clemenger BBDO Melbourne as their Technical Director.

I've been at Clemenger BBDO since January 2009. During that time I've been a Web Developer, Technical Lead, Creative Technologist and Technical Director. I've worked on every scale of project from simple banner ads to highly complex experiential campaigns, and I've been privileged to work with some truly talented and creative individuals.

Some of the award winning work I've been a part of:
